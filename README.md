### Physics Informed Neural Network - 1D Burgers Equation (WIP)

In this repo we strive to demonstrate the capability of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for the 1D Burgers equation. This equation represents fluid-like behavior and serves as a good benchmark for PINNs

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
$$
